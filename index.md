# Virtal Notebook 

I created this repository 📚 to organize and share my notes, projects, and discoveries. It’s a space for interesting finds, inspiring reads 📖, and recipes 🍲 that I’ve tried and loved. This way, it’s easier for me—and anyone else interested—to access and explore these resources! 🌟 both Portugueses and English as my brain.
